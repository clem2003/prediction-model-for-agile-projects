This project depicts a prediction model that is used to support a software project's supervisor/owner in predicting the end product's capability by knowing the performance level of each sprint. This model is built with the method of utilizing a number of features, namely characterictics from dataset containing iterations of software projects. Also, the model is built using Random Forest Regressor as the main method with KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) and Decision Tree Regressor being the comparison methods. 

The dataset used for this project are from a similar project and are cited within the link written below.
